Hi
===
I'm Sean.
I'm an infrastructure/systems programmer, I enjoy working on large backend systems and
low-level code.
I graduated from the Software Engineering program at University of Waterloo in April 2020.

I've worked on many projects spanning a range of fields,
including the [GAPID graphics debugger](https://github.com/google/gapid),
the [Zstandard compression algorithm](http://zstd.net),
and a variety of personal projects spanning
cryptography,
3D rendering,
games,
emulators,
and network protocols.
To see more of my projects, see my [resume](/resmue.pdf) for my work experience or
head to my [projects page](/projects/)
(or reload this page to see various snippets of my code in the background).

I also have a minor [patch in the Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/fs/squashfs/zstd_wrapper.c?id=87bf54bb43ddd385d2538b777324bf737f243042), from which I derive more pride than it deserves.

I like rock climbing, skating, hiking, swimming,
Zelda games, and Magic: the Gathering.
