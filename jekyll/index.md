Hi
==
I'm Sean, a third-year student at the University of Waterloo,
studying Software Engineering.

What I Do
=========
I've worked on many projects spanning a range of fields,
including the [Zstandard compression algorithm](http://zstd.net),
cryptography,
3D rendering,
games,
image analysis,
network protocols,
and app development.
To see more of my projects, head to my [projects page](/projects/)
(or reload this page to see various snippets of my code in the background).

In the past I've worked at:

- [Side Effects Software](https://sidefx.com),
implementing Optical Flow and Full-Body Inverse Kinematics
algorithms in their VFX software Houdini to allow for new effects and easier animating.

- [Facebook](https://facebook.com),
working on [Zstandard](http://zstd.net).  While I was there I worked on
improving speed and reliability, and developed new integrations for the library
such as in [SquashFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS)
and [libarchive](https://www.libarchive.org/).
I also wrote [my first kernel patch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=87bf54bb43ddd385d2538b777324bf737f243042).

- [Wish](https://wish.com), working on infrastructure.
While at Wish I cut internal network traffic by 50%,
and orchestrated the migration of a billion-row data collection to reduce
database load and improve efficiency.

I spent last summer working at [Wish](https://wish.com) on the infrastructure
team, improving stability and efficiency, as well as improving monitoring and
incident resolution.
While at Wish I cut internal network traffic by 50% and
migrated a multi-hundred million document collection to a new format,
reducing database load and improving server efficiency.

Additionally, I've worked at the Focused Ultrasound Lab at Sunnybrook Hospital
in Toronto, analyzing parallelized simulation software and using my findings
to optimize the program for speed, allowing for more efficient focused
ultrasound research.

I also like my girlfriend, rock climbing, skating, hiking, swimming,
Zelda games, and Magic: the Gathering.
