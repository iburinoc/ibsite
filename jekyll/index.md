Hi
==
I'm Sean, a first-year student at the University of Waterloo,
studying Software Engineering.  As the background would indicate, I like
coding, with particular interests in cryptography/security and
algorithmic contests.  Welcome to my [wobsite](http://xkcd.com/148).

What I Do
=========
I've worked on many projects spanning a range of fields,
including cryptography as mentioned above,
3D rendering,
games,
image analysis,
network protocols,
and app development.
To see more of my projects, head to my [projects page](/projects/)
(or reload this page to see various snippets of my code in the background).

I've also competed and performed well in both in the
Canadian Computing Olympiad, receiving a Gold Medal and placing in the top five,
and the ACM International Collegiate Programming,
placing third at the ECNA regional.

Additionally, I've worked at the Focused Ultrasound Lab at Sunnybrook Hospital
in Toronto, analyzing parallelized simulation software and using my findings
to optimize the program for speed, allowing for more efficient focused
ultrasound research.

Finally, I also like to rock climb, hike, swim, skate,
and play Zelda games.
