Hi
==
I'm Sean, a second-year student at the University of Waterloo,
studying Software Engineering.  As the background would indicate, I like
coding, with particular interests in compression, cryptography/security, and
algorithmic contests.

What I Do
=========
I've worked on many projects spanning a range of fields,
including the [Zstandard compression algorithm](http://zstd.net),
cryptography,
3D rendering,
games,
image analysis,
network protocols,
and app development.
To see more of my projects, head to my [projects page](/projects/)
(or reload this page to see various snippets of my code in the background).

I've also competed and performed well in both in the
Canadian Computing Olympiad, receiving a Gold Medal and placing in the top five,
and the ACM International Collegiate Programming,
placing third at the ECNA regional.

Last winter I worked at Facebook,
working on Zstandard as mentioned above,
developing new integrations to fully realize the potential of this algorithm,
and improving speed and reliability.

<!---
I spent last summer working at [Wish](https://wish.com) on the infrastructure
team, improving stability and efficiency, as well as improving monitoring and
incident resolution.
While at Wish I cut internal network traffic by 50% and
migrated a multi-hundred million document collection to a new format,
reducing database load and improving server efficiency.

Additionally, I've worked at the Focused Ultrasound Lab at Sunnybrook Hospital
in Toronto, analyzing parallelized simulation software and using my findings
to optimize the program for speed, allowing for more efficient focused
ultrasound research.

I also like to rock climb, hike, swim, skate,
and play Zelda games.
