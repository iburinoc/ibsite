Hi
==
I'm Sean, a third-year student at the University of Waterloo,
studying Software Engineering.

What I Do
=========
I've worked on many projects spanning a range of fields,
including the [GAPID graphics debugger](https://github.com/google/gapid),
the [Zstandard compression algorithm](http://zstd.net),
cryptography,
3D rendering,
games,
image analysis,
network protocols,
and app development.
To see more of my projects, head to my [projects page](/projects/)
(or reload this page to see various snippets of my code in the background).

In the past I've worked at:

- [Google](https://google.com),
working on [GAPID](https://github.com/google/.gapid).
I worked on various metrics and statistics tools to help debug Vulkan graphics
programs.

- [Side Effects Software](https://sidefx.com),
implementing Optical Flow and Full-Body Inverse Kinematics
algorithms in their VFX software Houdini to allow for new effects and easier animating.

- [Facebook](https://facebook.com),
working on [Zstandard](http://zstd.net).  While I was there I worked on
improving speed and reliability, and developed new integrations for the library
such as in [SquashFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS)
and [libarchive](https://www.libarchive.org/).
I also wrote [my first kernel patch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=87bf54bb43ddd385d2538b777324bf737f243042).

- [Wish](https://wish.com), working on infrastructure.
While at Wish I cut internal network traffic by 50%,
and orchestrated the migration of a billion-row data collection to reduce
database load and improve efficiency.

I also like rock climbing, skating, hiking, swimming,
Zelda games, and Magic: the Gathering.
