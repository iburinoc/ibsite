Background
---
"I don\'t like *MacBeth*, King Lear is a much better play." says my Grade 11 English teacher 2 days into reading *MacBeth* for class.
She made her preferences clear, so it was no surprise when I walked into the class on the first day of Grade 12 to find a large box full of copies of none other than the 'masterpiece' that was {{ kl }}.

Some background I suppose.  I live in Toronto, and my school has an annual trip to Stratford, Ontario.  It's a tradition that's been going on for several years now, every year 250 high school students dressed up in suits and fancy dresses show up in yellow school buses to the small town that is Stratford.  We watch two plays, stay up all night, watch another play and go home.  Fun times.  Unsurprisingly, my English teacher is the one who organizes the trip.

Back to King Lear.  It just so happens that this year the Stratford Festival Theatre is putting on a production of Shakespeare's famous tragedy {{ kl }}.  Sounds perfect right?

Little did we know there was another (slightly less death filled) tragedy (or blessing) waiting for us.  The trip is on October 2nd-3rd, and lo and behold, {{ kl }} isn't on that day day.  This trip is planned about a year in advance, and 80 hotel rooms in a town like Stratford can't exactly be rescheduled on such short notice.  "As flies to wanton boys are we to th'gods: / They kill us for their sport." (4.1.42-43) (Alright maybe we didn't quite have our eyes stabbed out, but you get the idea.)

What a terrible problem!  How shall we resolve this terrible issue?  Simple.  We go again!

The bus has a picture of mad Lear on it!

Fine I'll get to the important part.
