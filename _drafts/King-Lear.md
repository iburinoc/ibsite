title: King Lear at the Stratford Festival Theatre
kl: <i>King Lear</i>
---

Background
---
"I don\'t like *MacBeth*, *King Lear* is a much better play." says my Grade 11 English teacher 2 days into reading *MacBeth* for class.
She made her preferences clear, so it was no surprise when I walked into the class on the first day of Grade 12 to find a large box full of copies of none other than Shakespeare's famous tragedy {{ page.kl }}.

Some background I suppose.  I live in Toronto, and my school has an annual trip to Stratford, Ontario.  It's a tradition that's been going on for several years now, every year 250 high school students dressed up in suits and fancy dresses show up in yellow school buses to the small town that is Stratford.  We watch two plays, stay up all night, watch another play and go home.  Fun times.  Unsurprisingly, my English teacher is the one who organizes the trip.

Back to {{ page.kl }}.  It just so happens that this year the Stratford Festival Theatre is putting on a production it.  Sounds perfect right?

Little did we know there was another (slightly less death filled) tragedy (or blessing) waiting for us.  The trip is on October 2nd-3rd, and lo and behold, there was no {{ page.kl }} either of those days.  This trip is planned about a year in advance, and 80 hotel rooms in a town like Stratford can't exactly be rescheduled on such short notice.  "As flies to wanton boys are we to th'gods: / They kill us for their sport." (4.1.42-43) (Alright maybe we didn't quite have our eyes stabbed out, but you get the idea.)

What a terrible problem!  How shall we resolve this terrible issue?  Simple.  We go again!

The Trip

The bus has a picture of mad Lear on it!  It was also raining, which seemed fitting.  Very fitting.

Fine I'll get to the important part.

Warning: The actual review was handed in as part of an assignment for English class, which explains why I'm blogging about plays and not more technical things.

King Lear

The Stratford Festival's production of {{ page.kl }} is a harrowing portrayal of the cruelty and despair of Shakespeare's dark tragedy.

{{ page.kl }} begins with Lear dividing his kingdom among his daughters in return for professions of their love for him.  His elder daughters create over the top exclamations of affection, but when the youngest refuses to play along, Lear flies into a rage, initiating his mental deterioration and setting the scene for his downfall.

At the same time the Earl of Gloucester makes a similar mistake, allowing himself to be tricked by his illegitimate son into believing his legitimate son is plotting to kill him .

These two stories running in parallel create a depressing tale that was exemplified beautifully on the stage of the Stratford Festival Theatre.

Even before the opening scene, director Antoni Cimolino sets the tone with lightning-like flashes illuminating a sinister Edmund overlooking the stage.
Eo Sharo's setting supports this mood, with a dark wood stage and few props, presenting a bleak world appropriate for the event.

The combination of Michael Walton's lightning flashes briefly illuminating the stage, before returning to darkness, and Thomas Ryder Payne's rain pounding down make it feel like you're there in the raging storm with Lear as he battles through it, resulting in a very effective production of the famous storm scene.

All this is in support of an excellent cast.  Shakespeare's play revolves around Lear, and Colm Feore rises to this challenge.  He spent a year preparing for the role, and it shows, as appears to have no trouble slipping into Lear's skin, from his arrogance as he dividing his kingdom, to raving madness in the storm, to his complete despair with a lifeless Cordelia in his arms.

Following Lear around is Stephen Ouimette's quiet but powerful Fool.  Despite his title, the Fool seems to be to only one who sees the truth, and he's not afraid to say what he sees.

Maev Beaty's Goneril and Liisa Repo-Martell's Regan show how circumstances turn the two daughters into villains.  Usually depicted as a power-hungry backstabber, we genuinely feel bad for Goneril as her own father violently grabs her arm and curses her with sterility.

Scott Wentworth's Gloucester evokes true pity.  Betrayed by his son, he is unable to truly see until his eyes are gouged out, at which point it seems like he can see blindingly clearly despite his blood-red gaping eyes.

His two sons provide an interesting dichotomy, with Evan Buliung providing a loving, open, emotional Edgar, while Brad Hodder plays a self-interested, cold, emotionless Edmund.

There's also no character quite as purely evil as Mike Shara's Cornwall.  When he pounces on Gloucester to put out his second eye, you can feel the conscienceless cruelty.

This production of {{ page.kl }} is not afraid to face the darkness of the tragedy, and doesn't dilute it with visual distractions or upbeat characters.  Cimolino is trying to present the play to us the way Shakespeare intended, and he succeeds.
